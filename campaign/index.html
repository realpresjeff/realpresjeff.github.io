        Join me, Thomas Jefferson's grandson, in building a new American Empire
        rooted in conservative values, equality, and a blend of colonial values
        and direct democracy for the modern age.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Ashton Jefferson, and I’m here to serve the American people.
        With a rich heritage and vision for the future, I aim to blend colonial
        values with modern ideals, ensuring we protect our heritage while
        innovating for a better future.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a descendant of Thomas Jefferson, I bring unique perspectives to the
        role of President. Together, we can build a country that is not only
        powerful but fair and compassionate.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a descendant of both the colonized, the enslaved, and the founders, I
        understand both sides of America’s story. It’s time for policies that
        uplift all communities.

      <p>
        Here's where you’ll find the core principles that will guide my
        presidency:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Universal Basic Income (UBI):</strong> Provide every citizen
          with a monthly income to ensure economic security, framed as “the
          spoils of the new empire’s prosperity.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Immigration Reform:</strong> Closing the borders, while
          offering temporary work visas for Latinos and Americans to work
          seasonally, helping our economy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recognition of Indigenous Sovereignty:</strong> Push for dual
          governance models, where tribal nations operate as semi-independent
          entities within the American Empire, mirroring the Roman model of
          federated provinces. Think of every American nation as a new Puerto
          Rico. One Empire, Many Nations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Healthcare and Education for All:</strong> “A strong empire
          takes care of its people.” Provide universal healthcare and free
          public education, modeled after Indigenous community wellness systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Military and Defense:</strong> A “peace through strength”
          policy that bolsters national defense while avoiding unnecessary
          foreign conflicts. Emphasize protecting American interests globally.
        </li>
      </ul>
